This is a Repo for my Retroid Overclock Files and Guides

ALL STEPS ARE YOUR OWN CHOICE, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU BRICKING/COOKING YOUR DEVICE AND THIS WILL ALL VOID YOUR WARRANTY!  RETROID DOES NOT ENCOURAGE/SUPPORT ROOT OR OVERCLOCKING ANY OF THEIR DEVICES!

You will find the individual Overclock Boot Images i made here, as well as the full packa i released with all files included to perform ROOT and Overclock on your device.

These overclocks are ONLY for the following devices:

Retroid Pocket 5 
Retroid Pocket Mini v2 
Retroid Pocket Flip 2 Snapdragon Variant
